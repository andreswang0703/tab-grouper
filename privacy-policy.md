**Privacy Policy**

Tab Grouper does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.

This extension runs entirely locally in your browser. It does not use analytics, does not track usage, and does not send any information to third-party services or servers.

Permissions like "tabs" and "tabGroups" are only used to allow the extension to group and manage browser tabs. These actions occur on your local device only.

If you have questions, feel free to contact the developer.
